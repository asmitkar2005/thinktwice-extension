# ThinkTwice – Think Before You Buy 💸

ThinkTwice is a browser extension designed to help users make more mindful online shopping decisions. It introduces a short, intentional pause before purchases, encouraging users to reflect and avoid impulse buying.

## 🔹 What ThinkTwice Does
When you visit shopping or product pages on e-commerce websites, ThinkTwice shows a clean, iOS-style bottom prompt reminding you to pause before continuing. The prompt includes a short countdown so it cannot be dismissed instantly. Each time you continue, the extension quietly tracks the product price (stored locally only) to build spending awareness over time.
